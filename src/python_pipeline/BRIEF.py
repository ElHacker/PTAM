BRIEF Given an image, detects keypoints

Arguments:
    im- image

    kernel-Gaussian smoothing kernal for the image

    l-feature length for BRIEF

    S-Window size for BRIEF is SxS

    keypoints - array of Nx2. N rows, each corresponding to a keypoint.
    2 columns representing (x,y)

Returns:
    descriptors - N x l array of descriptors. N (rows) is the number of
    keypoints. l (cloumns) is the length of each feature.

BRIEF feature detector is implemented as follows:

1. Implemented on smoothed image.
2. Choose kernels used to smooth the patches before intensity differencing.
Default use gaussian kernel of 2 with patch size of 9x9.
3. Choose the spatial arrangement of the (x, y)-pairs.

BRIEF provides a shortcut to find the binary strings directly without
finding descriptors.It takes smoothened image patch and selects a set of
n_d (x,y) location pairs in an unique way (explained in paper).
Then some pixel intensity comparisons are done on these location pairs.
For eg, let first location pairs be p and q. If I(p) < I(q), then its
result is 1, else it is 0. This is applied for all the n_d location pairs
to get a n_d-dimensional bitstring. This n_d can be 128, 256 or 512.
By default, it would be 256 (OpenCV represents it in bytes.So the values
will be 16, 32 and 64). So once you get this, you can use Hamming Distance
to match these descriptors.

One important point is that BRIEF is a feature descriptor, it doesnâ€™t provide
any method to find the features. So you will have to use any other feature
detectors like SIFT, SURF etc. The paper recommends to use CenSurE which is
a fast detector and BRIEF works even slightly better for CenSurE points than
for SURF points.

In short, BRIEF is a faster method feature descriptor calculation and matching.
It also provides high recognition rate unless there is large in-plane rotation.
